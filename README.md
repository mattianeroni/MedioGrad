# MedioGrad
A ML library in the middle between [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) and [Micrograd](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd).

Not evoluted as [TinyGrad](https://github.com/tinygrad/tinygrad) since objective is to be [numpy](https://numpy.org/)-based only (maybe in future with a bit of [pycuda](https://documen.tician.de/pycuda/)).
